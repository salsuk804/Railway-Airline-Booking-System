Railway-Airline Booking System

*********Note: This project was developed without the use of any built-in functions or advanced libraries. All logic, data handling, and control flow were implemented manually using basic programming constructs, as per the constraints of the final year project*********

Project Overview
This is a Final Year Project that implements a comprehensive Railway and Airline Booking System. The system allows users to search, book, and manage train and flight tickets through a unified console-based interface.

Assumptions:

- City of Origin: All flights and trains are assumed to operate from the city of Lahore.
- Passenger Age: Only passengers aged 18 and above are allowed to book tickets.
- Maximum Records: The system can store a maximum of 10 passenger records.
- Ticket Limit: A maximum of 5 tickets can be booked at a time for any flight or train.
- Fixed Schedules: The flight and train schedules, including departure times and costs, are predefined and do not change dynamically.
- Simple Interface: The application operates through a console interface, and user inputs are assumed to be valid (no extensive error handling).
- Deposit Requirement: Passengers must deposit an amount greater than or equal to the total cost of the tickets before confirmation.
- Cancellation Policy: All recent tickets booked by a passenger can be canceled at once, and the available seats will be reset to their maximum capacity.


Features

- Display Flights and Trains: View available options with details such as available seats, departure times, transport numbers, and ticket costs.
- Add Passenger Records: Add personal information (name, age, CNIC/passport number, contact number).
- Book Tickets: Book tickets for flights or trains based on destination and number of tickets.
- Cancel Tickets: Cancel all recent bookings and update seat availability.
- Search Passenger Records: Search using CNIC or passport number.
- Filter Options: Filter flights and trains by destination or departure time.
- Generate Report: View a report of all recent bookings made by passengers.


Code Structure

1. Main Function:

The main function contains the core logic of the application. It presents a menu-driven interface implemented using a do-while loop that continues until the user chooses to exit.

2. Data Structures:
The application uses multiple arrays to manage data for passengers, bookings, flights, and trains.


** Passenger Information Arrays:

-  passName[10]: Stores passenger names
-  passID[10]: Stores CNIC or passport numbers
-  passAge[10]: Stores passenger ages
-  passContact[10]: Stores contact numbers
-  passBalance[10]: Stores account balances, initialized to zero


** Ticket Booking Arrays:

-  recentBooking[10]: Stores recent bookings for each passenger
-  passTicktCount[10]: Tracks number of tickets booked by each passenger
  

** Flight Information Arrays:

-  PIAseats[3]: Tracks available seats for Pakistan International Airline
-  FlyJinnahSeats[3]: Tracks available seats for Fly Jinnah
-  PIA_Cities[3]: Stores destination cities for PIA flights
-  FLY_J_Citites[3]: Stores destination cities for Fly Jinnah flights
-  PIA_Cost[3]: Stores ticket costs for PIA flights
-  FLY_J_Cost[3]: Stores ticket costs for Fly Jinnah flights
-  PIA_FlightNumbers[3]: Stores flight numbers for PIA
-  FLY_J_FlightNumbers[3]: Stores flight numbers for Fly Jinnah
-  PIA_Departure[3]: Stores departure times for PIA flights
  

** Train Information Arrays:

-  PakExpress_Seats[3]: Tracks available seats for Pakistan Express trains
-  FastExpress_Seats[3]: Tracks available seats for Fast Express trains
-  PakExpress_Cities[3]: Stores destination cities for Pakistan Express
-  FastExpress_Cities[3]: Stores destination cities for Fast Express
-  PakExpress_Cost[3]: Stores ticket costs for Pakistan Express trains
-  FastExpress_Cost[3]: Stores ticket costs for Fast Express trains
-  PakExpress_TrainNumber[3]: Stores train numbers for Pakistan Express
-  FastExpress_TrainNumner[3]: Stores train numbers for Fast Express
-  PakExpress_Departure[3]: Stores departure times for Pakistan Express trains


3. Control Flow:

The program operates using a do-while loop to continuously display the main menu until the user exits. Menu options are handled using if and else if conditions.


4. Key Variables:

- counter: Tracks the number of passengers added
- choice: Stores the user's main menu selection
- transportChoice: Stores the user's choice between airline or train
- AirLineChoice: Stores selected airline
- TrainChoice: Stores selected train
- y: Tracks the number of recent bookings
